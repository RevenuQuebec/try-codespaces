## devcontainers

Definitions for devcontainers and examples how to use them.

Container definitions are base on Microsoft devcontainers from Github repository [microsoft/vscode-dev-containers](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dev-containers)

Also I added some extras from my experience working with VS Code Remote Development / Codespaces.
